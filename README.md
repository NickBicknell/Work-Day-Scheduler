# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

I created a work day scheduler to help plan an organize a work day schedule. The work day scheduler is a great tool to keep track of events throughout the day by allowing you to schedule and save them to the page. The color changing scheme depending on what time of day it is (ex: past hours turn grey, current hour turns red, and future hours turn green) allow you to easily see what current hour of the day it is and what needs to be accomplished that hour. I learned a lot more about using jquery and using the *this* value. I got more confident in using and saving content to the local storage.

## Usage

When you are on the webpage you see different time blocks labeled 9AM-5PM. The color of the time block reflects the current time of day. The time blocks allow you to type and add tasks and todos. The save button at the right of the time block saves whatever is inputed to local storage. If the page is closed or refreshed, as long as you save your input to local storage via the save button, your input/data will still be there. At the bottom of the page I added a clear scheduler button to clear the local storage and refresh the time block inputs.
